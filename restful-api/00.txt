🌐 Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS
Feature	HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)	HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
Security	No encryption, vulnerable to attacks	Uses SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication
Data Protection	Data is sent in plaintext, easily intercepted	Data is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping
Port	Uses port 80	Uses port 443
SEO & Trust	Less trusted by users and browsers	Preferred for SEO, marked as secure in browsers
Use Cases	Suitable for public websites with no sensitive data	Used for banking, e-commerce, and login pages
📩 Basic Structure of HTTP Requests and Responses
1️⃣ HTTP Request
An HTTP request consists of:

Request Line: Specifies the HTTP method, resource URL, and HTTP version (e.g., GET /index.html HTTP/1.1).
Headers: Provides additional information (e.g., User-Agent, Content-Type).
Body: Contains data for methods like POST and PUT.

2️⃣ HTTP Response
An HTTP response consists of:

Status Line: Contains the HTTP version, status code, and status message (e.g., HTTP/1.1 200 OK).
Headers: Metadata like Content-Type, Date, etc.
Body: The actual content (HTML, JSON, etc.).

HTTP requests contain a method, headers, and an optional body.
Responses include a status code, headers, and a body.
Understanding HTTP methods and status codes is key to debugging web applications!
